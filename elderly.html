                        <h2> A Community Left Behind</h2>
                        <p>The idea for this StoryMap came from my interest in urban planning and the love and
                            compassion I have for elderly people. All throughout high school I worked at a retirement
                            home outside of Chicago. Through this opportunity, I gained a unique perspective on how
                            elderly people exist in cities and the importance of city infrastructure that caters to this
                            demographic. The aesthetics of this piece was a difficult decision. Because it is such a
                            serious topic I first wanted dark colors and a serious mood. However, I decided to change
                            course and go for a newspaper feel with cream colored background and typography as a way to
                            allude to the fact that this is still the main source of media that older people consume.
                            Furthermore, I choose my accent colors to be darker colors like the dark purple and green to
                            help carry on the serious mood. I also tried to be very intentional about my dosing. The
                            piece was originally very text-heavy so I tried to break the text up with pictures,
                            sidecars, bigger text, and intentional spacing. Lastly, for my bivariate map, I felt it was
                            important to show the current state of where elderly people are living in the US and where
                            people indicated having four or more physical conditions of the house that are indicators of
                            unhealthy housing. I also wanted to continue the theme colors although I experienced
                            limitations on carrying these colors on completely. I feel as though this part of the story
                            could have been more impactful if I compared the location of elderly people with one, two,
                            and three housing conditions that lead to unhealthy housing; however due to time
                            constraints, this was not possible.</p>
