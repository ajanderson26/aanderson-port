                        <h2>If Wes Anderson was a Basemap</h2>
                        <p>If Wes Anderson was a Basemap is the result of a mapping project that focused on map
                            aesthetics. I created a basemap in Mapbox Studio that follows the aesthetic of my two
                            favorite Wes Anderson movies, Moonrise Kingdom and Grand Budapest Hotel. This basemap most
                            closely aligns with an art deco pastiche in terms of its similarities in form, color,
                            texture and type. In regards to form, my map includes louder and quirky icons for road
                            networks and places of interest. A vintage key is used to show all places of interest. The
                            key has a more geometric shape and regular curves which acts to enhance the art deco design.
                            The map is designed so that as you zoom in closer to a location these icons appear to better
                            describe local geographies and not overwhelm the map with too many entities that could end
                            up being distracting. It is also important to note that the icons do not change depending on
                            location but only scale to bring unity to map. Color is also a major part of the design.
                            Color is used the most to convey the aesthetic. The map represents art deco pastiche in that
                            there are large blocks of color that go uninterrupted. For example, the stark difference in
                            blue and pink between land and water respectively. I also use saturation with zoom effects.
                            As the user zooms in, all colors gain a heavier saturation in order to put emphasis on local
                            geographies. In terms of texture, the contrast of the smooth land texture and the scratchy
                            or grainy texture of the water juxtaposes the expected texture of water which is smooth and
                            soft with what it is portrayed as in the map as a scratchy/grainy texture. In Wes Anderson
                            movies, you should expect the unexpected which is why I used texture in this way. Also,
                            texture does not vary across scale or location. Finally, the map follows the typical
                            typography of the art deco pastiche. Typography varies at different scales as countries,
                            continents, and states have a different typeface than cities and towns but does not vary
                            across location. Futura is one of the most popular typefaces of the art deco pastiche which
                            is why a variation of it is used on my map. Furthermore, Futura pairs beautifully with a
                            more opulent typeface called Andara that is used for state, country, and continent labels.
                            It has a very organic, handwritten form which is not typical of art deco but is very lavish
                            which is why it is used here. This typeface is also used because it is a very similar
                            pairing of fonts found in another one of my favorite Wes Anderson movies called Moonrise
                            Kingdom where very similar typefaces are used in the opening and closing credits. Click the
