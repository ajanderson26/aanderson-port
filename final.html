                            <h2>Profit Over People StoryMap</h2>
                            <p>Profit Over People, a StoryMap, is about chain displacement, as a result of evictions in the City of Madison and Dane County. I worked with UW-Madison researchers Revel Sims and Alicia Iverson to gather their data and resources as I based my story around their research in chain displacement. The goal of this project was to create a narrative of someone experiencing chain displacement and generate empathy for the character, Mara, in order to humanize some very important research. This story includes three maps. The first two maps are a Residential security map including points of sites where single eviction filings occurred and where multiple eviction filings against the same person occurred in order to help the viewer understand important historical contexts. The third map is a proportional symbol map of multiple evictions by block group in order to compare locations of multiple evictions within Dane County and between different block groups.
